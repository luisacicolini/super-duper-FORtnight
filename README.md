# Minimart Project - Foundations of Operations Research

### Structure

* minimart.mod contains the first part of the model, solved using AMPL. This code covers the first part of the problem, i.e., choosing the best location to build the facilities according to the given constraints in order to minimize the buliding costs uniquely.
* minimartMain.py contains the proposed heuristic to determine the best routes which minimize refurbishing costs. 

### Building and Running Settings

Before running the code: 
* set ampl solver location in minimartMain.py (line 11)
* set minimart.mod location in minimartMain.py (line 17)
* set datafile location in minimartMain.py (line 19)
